# HW2

For this homework, there are three problems.
* [Box Text](https://github.com/CMPSC-1500/HW2/blob/master/Problems/Problem%201)
* [Texting](https://github.com/CMPSC-1500/HW2/blob/master/Problems/Problem%202.md)
* [Roman Numerals](https://github.com/CMPSC-1500/HW2/blob/master/Problems/Problem%203.md)

These programs are a bit more involved than the programs we have been working with.  By that I mean that there are multiple parts that interact and will need to be managed.  Functions will likely be helpful to divide out logic into smaller problems to solve, and to use when you need to repeat actions.  Recursion may be helpful on some of them.

When working on these, check code in often.  Let me see where you are.  Remember that problem solving and appllication of logic is what I'm looking for in the course (as well as using the things we discussed in the course.)

My suggestion is to divide the problem up into parts.  What has to work for the program to function, then add in restrictions/constraints after you have the core part working.  One way to do this is to work through what the functions are you need to have work, and create them, but not put any code in them, and then work through them one by one (possibly dividing this task up into funcions as well.)

Please do create a folder with your name/username for the place you are going to store your work inside the "Student Work" folder.  I strongly encourage you to upload into this any work you do for planning out your programs (flow charts, notes written on paper, psudeocode to think through the logic of how you intend to approach the problem.)

Good luck, be well!
